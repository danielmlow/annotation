# Diarization annotator

Listen to interview 511_7min.wav for a couple of minutes to get acquainted with interviewer and participantâ€™s voices
Open terminal
Go to folder annotation:
```cd ./path/to/annotation/```

Follow these steps:
```python -m venv env```
```source env/bin/activate```
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run script in terminal:
```python annotate_diarization.py --511 --0```

Instructions:
```>>> Who is speaking: i, p, b, n, r?``` 
Where i=interviewer, p=participant, b=both, n=not clear/noise, r = repeat
Enter q to quit. Pay attention to the message: (replace 0 above in 5.a. if instructed to after quitting). For example:
```=====You quit midway. Restart on file 10=====```

To resume write the following in terminal:
```python annotate_diarization.py --511 --N```
Where N is the number it instructed. For example:
```python annotate_diarization.py --511 --10```

Send me these outputs that will be inside ./annotation/
./annotation/511_diarization.txt
./annotation/511_log

Deactivate from virtual environment in terminal
```deactivate```

# Evaluate diarization on annotated interviewer (1) and random snippets from other interview (0)
Once you obtain an annotation for fileX.wav, goal is to train classifier to detect interviewer I1 in fileX.wav
Segment a different interview with different interviewer and speaker into wavs

Feature extraction and normalization on wavs

Training data: 
* 1 = half of I1 511
* 0: random snippets from second interview 108

Test data A
* 1 = other half of I1 511
* 0: random snippets from second interview 108

Test data B
Annotate a I1 samples from a third interview 509
* 1 = I1 samples from a third interview 509
* 0: random snippets from second interview 108
